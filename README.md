#building a mockup

I was looking for a website mockup to build over the internet and I found this one so I decided to build it.
I was faced with two difficulties:
1-I didn't had the access to the background image so I used a CSS gradient instead.
2- the screen of my laptop is small compared to what the mockup was designed for. So I sliced apart so it
so it can fit well on my screen.
